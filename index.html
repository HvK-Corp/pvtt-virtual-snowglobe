        <p>Dear Anveshika,</p>
        <p>It has been a year of our friendship, and it's your 3rd birthday with me! You've been the best friend I ever had, so today I want to wish you and give you something.</p>
        <p>On your 15th birthday, I wish you a great, sweet, and smiling life ahead. Soon you'll step into the real world, I hope you achieve great success (especially in singing, I know ^_^).</p>
        <p>Happy Birthday! Since we can't meet, I wanted to give you something special. Here, I have a snow globe for you, and I hope you love it.</p>
        <p>I'll buy myself a chocolate. I don't want to ruin your mood for the second time on the same date and month for another year in a row ヾ(≧▽≦*)o</p>
        <p>Your Best Friend,</p>
        <p>Daksh</p>
